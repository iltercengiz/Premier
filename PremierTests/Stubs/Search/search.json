Gjoleka founds himself in between of the ideas of his wild father, Abas and his illuminist godfather, Servet.  Gjoleka symbolizes the young generation in the difficult realities that offer small and underdeveloped countries, where the outside world constitutes an irresistible attraction. The movie shows with a deep realism the human relationships, such as love, jalousie, hate, the impossibility to be integrated with another world, making this way a cruel autopsy of the weird society to which, \"sometime\" we belong.",
